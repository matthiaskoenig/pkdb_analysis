Whether a parameter was reported for individuals, groups and whether an error (SD or SE) was reported is shown as a triplet (in this order). Either, a parameter was reported for all individuals/groups ($\checkmark$), only for some individuals/groups ($\oslash$) or not reported (empty).}

Either, time course data (or errors) was reported for all individuals/groups ($\checkmark$), only for some individuals/groups ($\oslash$) or not reported (empty).}
