r"""The study report: the tables and the figures of an analysis in one document.

An analysis of `pkpdutils` ends in data frames and figures; a study report is
those pieces in the order ICH M13A (2024, 2.2.2) asks for, in a file which can
be sent around. `Report` collects the pieces - a paragraph, a table, a figure -
and writes them as a self-contained HTML page (the figures embedded as base64
PNG, so the file travels alone) or as markdown next to its figure files.
`study_report` assembles the package of a bioequivalence or single dose study
from a batch and its result: the sentence describing the methods, the summary
statistics M13A names, the acceptability of the extrapolation, the parameters
of every subject, the mean curves and the individual panels.

Nothing here decides anything: every number comes from the analysis which was
run, and every table is the one the matching function of `pkpdutils` returns,
so a report can be extended with any further frame or figure of the package
before it is written.
