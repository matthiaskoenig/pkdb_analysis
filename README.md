# `pyPKDB` - Computational analysis based on PK-DB


This repository contains meta-analyses and example use cases of the data in the PKDB database.

## Installation
To run the analysis scripts create a virtual environment with the required dependencies.
```
mkvirtualenv pkdb_analysis --python=python3.7
(pyPKDB) pip install -e .
# optional for jupyter notebooks
(pyPKDB) pip install jupyterlab
(pyPKDB) pip install ipykernel
(pyPKDB) python -m ipykernel install --user --name pyPKDB
```
The scripts are running against a given endpoint on which the PKDB backend is running.


Subsequently the virtualenv must be registered as jupyter kernel to use it for the analysis.
